This is the first website I ever built and deployed!

This site is for the band program that I use to work for. While thinking about this project I knew I wanted to make a fully functional website only using HTML, CSS and javascript. I spent six years of my life working in the community so what better way to start then making a site for the program!

While there insn't a whole lot of javascript involved in this one you will see that the CSS is a little extensice. I learned a lot designing the navbar from CSS compared to react.

Hope you enjoy looking at it and learning a little about the program!
